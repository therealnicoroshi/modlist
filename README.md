## Overview:

***

This is the mod list I personally play. I would describe it as a power fantasy list with 
emphasis on visuals, combat, new creatures, new places, and fast paced game play.
I could write a book on this, and still have more to say so I will just put it to you like this.
I am very OCD, and want the best of everything in my Skyrim. 
This mod list is the result of playing and modding this game since the day of it's release
So if you're looking for a visually stunning Skyrim experience that will push the graphical 
limits of what Skyrim can be I invite you to take a trip through
The Nico Experience 

***

## Requirements and Information

***

### Disclaimer

**The Nico Experience** only supports **English Steam** versions of Skyrim Anniversary Edition. **GOG and other Languages are not supported**. The specific version used is 1.5.97 with the creation club content from 1.6.1170.

**Your Keyboard MUST be set to English U.S. or Eldritch Blast will fail to download**

:warning: :exclamation: **THE NICO EXPERIENCE REQUIRES THE FULL PAID UPDATE TO SKYRIM ANNIVERSARY EDITION. IT IS NOT/WILL NOT BE MADE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NON PAID UPDATE OR OLDER VERSIONS** :exclamation: :warning:

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK**. Your windows version **must be 21H2 or newer** to run both Wabbajack and **The Nico Experience**.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is **STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST**. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and RAM are needed.

### Note:

The files that will need to be downloaded for this mod list to function come from Nexus and Lovers Lab via Mega Downloads. As such you will need an account on both sites to be able to download the mods needed to build this list.

***

## Recommended System Specifications

***

**The Nico Experience** requires a mid to high-tier modern system to run to its fullest potential. The recommended specs given below are based on utilizing the ENB in the list, and running the included VRAMr at Performance settings. For community shaders, you can subtract a little bit from them. Users have reported being able to run on hardware slightly lower than this, however your mileage may vary.

***

| Component    | Recommended for 1080p | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| CPU | 10th Generation i5 or better/equivalent
| Ram | 16GB DDR4 Ram  + 40GB Pagefile 
| Storage | SATA SSD or higher
| GPU | RTX 3060 or better/equivalent (12 GB VRAM)

***

| Component    | Recommended for 1440p | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| CPU | 12th Generation i7 or better/equivalent
| Ram | 32GB DDR4 Ram  + 40GB Pagefile 
| Storage | M.2 SSD
| GPU | RTX 4070ti Super or better/equivalent (16GB + VRAM)

***

Space required: ~173GB Archives  ~342GB install Size  40GB Page file ~555GB Total so recommend 600GB of space allocated for this list.

See how to setup a page file here: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html

:warning: **NOTE**: AMD RX 580 and older cards are **not supported**. :warning:

***

## Installation

***

Installing **The Nico Experience** is relatively easy if you have Nexus Premium, and a Lovers Lab account will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](README.md#updating).

***

  ## Pre-installation

  Prior to installing **The Nico Experience**, please complete the following steps.


1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v8 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
5. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonist's [SteamLibrary tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide).
6. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
7. Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the paid addon files. **DO NOT VERIFY YOUR GAME FILES**
8. Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These **will** mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.

***

  ## Wabbajack Installation

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [Latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

:warning: **NOTE**: **The Nico Experience** will **always** require the latest version of Wabbajack **UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY STATED HERE**. :warning:

***

  ## Downloading and Installing The Nico Experience

Downloading and installing **The Nico Experience** can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists. At the top in the Games Window choose Skyrim Special Edition. Check mark next to Show Unofficial Lists.
2. Press the download button on The Nico Expereince, and wait for it to download. Once downloaded The arrow down will change to a 'Play' Arrow facing right. Press that to begin installation of the list.
3. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\The Nico Expereince. **Do not install it to your desktop, or ANY protected Windows folders like Program Files or Downloads.**
4. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster.
5. Make sure you are logged into Mega, Nexus and Lover's Lab then Press the play button to begin.
6. Some files will need to be manually downloaded during the installation process. If they fail for any reason see [potentially problematic files](#potentially-problematic-files) for links and instructions to resolve
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

***

## Problems with installation

***

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.
	

 ## - Could not download x:

 Sometimes due to multiple downloads happening at once some files may not download correctly from Nexus or Lovers Lab manual downloads.
 
 Running wabbajack again should allow these files to download.
 
  ### Potentially Problematic Files
  
 If any of the larger files from Mega fails to download use the links below to download the files manually then add the archives to your download folder location for the list, and re-run Wabbajack to continue.

***

## Post Installation

***

Open the installation folder and double-click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

❗  **IMPORTANT STEPS DO NOT SKIP** ❗

## Run VRAMr on performance setting

### You can find VRAMr at the far right of the top of MO2 where all the executables are.

#### This will take about an hour to run but important to reduce VRAM Usage and avoid system stutter while playing. Recommend Performance setting for everyone.

- [Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se6oAvmtaBE&t=1s)

Once complete drag and drop the folder it creates (that is clearly marked "DragNDropThisFolderIntoModManager") between Texgen_Output and Dyndolod_Output in MO2 '94. LOD Generation Output'

Allow it time to install then activate the plug in by clicking on the box to checkmark it.

#### Save this folder as it will need to be re-installed if you update the list later ❗ 

Just repeat the Drag and drop step after any update.

### You will need to set the player ID to use 'Skyrim Save System Overhaul'. Follow the instructions [here>>>](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122343?tab=description)


❗ **IMPORTANT NOTE** ❗

In the right pane of MO2 click on 'Data' at the top.
Navigate to Textures/interface/intfullnebulapanarama02.dds
Right click / Hide 

This is because VRAMr **WILL** downsize the image of the girls in the perk interface and we are hiding the one from VRAMr so that it uses the higher resolution original one.

### *Note:* If you want to remove the girls in the Perk tree completely hide both the VRAMr downsized file and the original


### Stock Game

The Nico Experience utilizes a Wabbajack technology called Stock Game. What this essentially does is create a copy of your Skyrim installation within the installation location of the list. This enables greater compatibility with other mod-lists.


### Change this line

#### In MO2 find 'Tools' in the top left and click on it. Navigate to ini editor/ SkyrimPrefs.ini/[Launcher] sD3DDevice="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090

Change this line to reflect the graphics card you are using if not changed automatically:

#### Also Change this line in MO2/Tools/ini editor/Skrim.ini to reflect where you want screenshots saved:

[Display]/sScreenShotBaseName=X:\Modding\Screenshots\ScreenShot

### Set your affinity

In MO2 top left find the tools tab again, and click on it.

Find: 
### *Set CPU Affinity* 

Click it and allow it to set the affinty for your processor.

### Set Voice type

Set PC head tracking in MO2 left pane under Dialog to your preferred voice type before starting the game.
❗ Choose only One ❗
(Note): The Dragon born voice over can be set to match with game running in the MCM Menu.


***

## Widescreen Support

***

###  (skip to First Start Up if playing 16:9 format):

### Optional Setting the HUD for widescreen resolution.

Search in MO2 Left pane for 'Wide'.

#### *Enable all of them (There should be 4 files found).*

#### *Search MO2 left pane for Widgets and re-install STB Widgets for 21:9 format*

#### *Search MO2 Left pane for The Elder Scrolls Legends - Loading Screens and re-install for 21:9 format*

### **Don't forget to run Bethini and change your resolution, and LOOT in the top exe icons to sort your load order**

***

## *No official controller support provided*

However people have gotten controllers to work with this list and there is a Beta Controller map on the Discord to try provided as is by Gremlin

***

## Congratulations you are now installed and ready for first start up.

***

## First Start up

***

Open the installation folder and double-click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `The Nico Experience (version number)` and press the `Run` button. 

Alternate method is clicking on the .exe link at the top labeled `The Nico Experience (version number)`

This will start the game and bring you to the character creation menu.

### *NOTE:*

#### This will take a few minutes to start up as the game needs to compile shaders for ENB on first start up. Be Patient.

After your character is created and you name them >>>

 ### The MCM Menu:

As of Version 1_3_2 the MCM Recorder should Auto Run on new game start with recommended settings.

### ❗ IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALLOW THE MCM RECORDER FULLY COMPLETE BEFORE CONTINUING ❗

#### *If this fails for any reason or gets stuck you can edit the .ini for MCM Recorder in MO2 and disable the auto run feature, If it has trouble with one or more of the mods choose 'skip this mod' as you can configure it after the MCMRecorder completes* 

You can still go through the menu and change things to suit your preference afterward but this will give you a solid base to start from.

#### Some important things to leave disabled for stability reasons

Leave Minatours and Spiders Off in OBIS

Leave Extra spawns Ore Guardians Off in Immersive Creatures

Leave shadows OFF in Strange Runes

#### By default The voice for PC head tracking and Dragonborn voice over is set for Bella, and Female Sultry. This can be changed in the MCM.

#### Spell HotBar will be empty by default, and show when weapons are drawn. Assign Keys to the slots/ Tweak size, Amount, and location in the MCM. Add Spells to it by opening the in game magic menu Hovering over a spell then clicking the assigned hot key for a slot on the bar.


### *As of Version 1.8.8 Function Key 11 (F11) will pull up the KeyMapping image seen here. It can be modified in game by clicking on a key and changing it's values. Tab to exit*

### ❗ NOTE: This is only an image and DOES NOT change keymapping itself ❗ It is only a quick reference that will need to be updated if you change any key Mapping.

### It will look Something like this>>>

![](https://github.com/therealnicoroshi/modlist/blob/main/SkyrimSE%202024-08-26%2022-47-26.jpg?raw=true)

Caps Lock + Enter = ENB Menu

Caps Lock + F12 = Toggle ENB Effect

Caps Lock + F11 = Toggle Wire Frame

Shift + O = Open Animation Replacer

Scroll wheel = walk\run speed adjustment on the fly

L (Hold) + Scroll Wheel = Zoom

End = STB Widgets Config

Up Arrow = Opens progress bar for dropping from snare trap

W (repeated) = fills progress bar to drop from snare trap

###  ❗ *DLAA or FSR 3.1 Settings in ENB* ❗

Open ENB menu in game using Caps Lock + Enter. 

In the left pane under Anti-Alaising choose either DLAA or FSR 3.1

### ❗ IT IS RECOMMENDED AT THIS TIME TO OPEN THE IN GAME MENU TO 'CONTROLS' AND CHANGE ANY KEY BINDINGS TO SUIT YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES ❗

### ❗ DEFAULT KEY MAPPING CAN BE SET FOR MOST KEYS BY PRESSING ESC KEY/CONTROLS/DEFAULT BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM ❗

### ⚠️ As of version 2.1.9 The majority of the keymapping has been returned to default ⚠️

#### *NOTE: All of these (except the swan and short dive keys of 'X', and 'C') can be changed to suit your preference either in settings/controls menu in game, the MCM menu or through the ini files for the specific mod found in MO2 left pane.*

#### *Dodge key can be changed by searching in MO2 (bottom left) for 'TK Dodge RE'. In the skse/plugins/TK Dodge RE.ini change the DodgeHotkey = to the numerical value of the key desired using the DX scan codes linked below*

- [DirectX Scan Codes for ini values](https://gist.github.com/arithex/3e953d1eb096afe58ce05ba6846493e4)

### Now you can talk to Mara and start your adventure

### ❗ DO NOT save your created character using Proteus UNTIL AFTER you have talked to Mara, spawned in Skyrim, and messages in upper left have completed ❗


***

## Updating

***

#### ❗ If you have changed default key mapping and are updating save the file in the mo2/Stock Game folder called ControlMap_Custom.txt BEFORE updating. Drop this file into the updated mod list in the Stock game folder and let it overwrite to save your key mapping changes after update. ❗

#### ❗After updating the list you will need to re-install the generated VRAMr folder Called: "DragNDropThisFolderIntoModManager" between Texgen_Output and Dyndolod_Output in MO2 '94. LOD Generation Output'❗

#### Unless noted otherwise in the change log all Updates will be Save Safe

#### Updating should be as simple as downloading the latest 'The Nico Experience' from Wabbajack, and running it with the same MO2 and Downloads install paths as your existing installation making sure to check the 'overwrite installation' box in the bottom right corner.

 ## Included Tools:

 ***

 ⚠️ ❗ **NOTE: These are provided for those that wish to add to this list however Official Support will not be given on modified lists** ❗ ⚠️

Bethini Pie

SSEedit and QuickAutoClean

LOOT

Cathedral Assets Optimizer

Nemesis

Bodyslide and Outfit Studio

NifSkope

ReSaver

VRAMr

***

 ## About Adding More Tools:

***

All the tools you choose to install in addition to these need to link in the top right executable bar in MO2 so these programs can start from within the virtual file structure of MO2.
This Wabbajack uses a file structure that contains a folder called 'Stock Folder' in the MO2 directory.
This is where the game will run from. It will NOT run from Skyrim Special Editions Folder so ALL links to executables NEED to point to the Stock Folder in Arguements to work correctly.
 

Find this in MO2 executable bar under <EDIT....> then on the binary click the 3 dots and navigate to your file path for that exe to change this file paths to lead to your specific file install paths OR IT WILL NOT WORK. They are currently set for my file paths. Use those as a reference on how to set them up.
Good tutorial on how to set these up is here >>>>
[Tutorial on setting up executables in stock folder](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Setting%20up%20Stock%20Game%20for%20Skyrim%20SE.md#tool-setup)


***

  ## Some Notes On Basic System Set Up:

***
	
This mod list IS graphically taxing on the hardware but systems can run it if they have the room to breathe.
I'm not going to hold your hand on this, and assume you know Google-fu for anything you don't understand here.

1. Turn off any start up programs or background programs that do not need to be on while running the game.   
There are guides on the web on how to go through Services.msc to trim the fat out of the Windows System Services.

2. strip that graphics driver down of any AA, AO, AF settings (Turn off) as those effects will be handled by the game engine or the ENB. 
*DO NOT DOUBLE UP ON EFFECTS!*  It will kill your framerate and will not look any better than only one doing that specific effect.
Run Gsync if avialable and for Heavens sake DO NOT use the in game vsync. Use driver vsync instead.
Run latency at ultra and any settings you can at high performance in the driver.

3. Run resizable bar if your hardware is capable of it. It widens the bandwidth for better file transfer speeds (i.e. smoother gameplay)
Panjano has a good video on how to set this up
 [>>>Here<<<](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DqcgHtkm9I)


4. Go to system settings and set virtual memory on the drive the mod organizer is on at 40GB min and 40GB Max. Save and restart.
This will be your swap file and supplement the VRAM if needed.

5. Make sure your power plan is set for High performance and **NOT** balanced or power saver

6. Highly recommended to set up a standby memory purge Windows sceduled task. Good video on how to do that here>>> [Empty Standbu List Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAxuGjdahd0)

***

## Performance Tweaks

***

   Here are some things I recommend if your framerate is still suffering after applying the Performance VRAMr and following the notes on 'Basic system set up' above.

  1. Run BethINI (included tool) and choose a lower preset setting like Medium. The default is High. Be sure to NOT use Ambient Occusion, Screen Space Reflections, and turn Tree LOD Distance to '0'. These effects are being handled by Reshade, ENB, and DynDOLOD. Remember DO NOT DOUBLE UP ON EFFECTS! It will cost twice the frame cost with no change in visuals!
   
  2. Turn the settings on the effects in ENB to low or medium (default is high/Very high). These are in the left pane when you open ENB and can be seen when expanding each effect individually.
   
  3. Run at a lower resolution. 
   
  4. Lower the grass density in 'Explore Virtual Folder/Net Script Framework/Plugins/GrassControlConfig.txt/OverwriteMinGrassSize = 65' by INCREASING this number to something like 75-80.
  

#### ❗*IMPORTANT: If you plan to use lossless scaling you should disable ENB Frame Gen in the 4.Optimazation section in the left pane of MO2 ❗


   ## *Some Users have reported being able to run this list on hardware BELOW the minimum I feel it needs*

   In addition to the tweaks recommended above people have removed the ENB from the list to trade graphical fidelity for frame rate.

   I have seen this list play on a 1080ti trading ENB and reshade for Community Shaders.

   It has also been reported to play on a graphics card that only has 8GB of VRAM. YMMV.

   We do have a topic in the Discord for people to discuss what they have done to get it to run on hardware below the recommended minimum.

***

  ## Known Issues:

***

### ❗Various issues related to reloading saves from within the game or exiting to the main menu and reloading from there. If you want the most bug free experience, always close and restart the game to load a save. ❗

### With MO2 Executables not working as intended

Find the tools folder within your MO2 installation folder, and the .exe of the application inside it's respective folder (Example: D:\The Nico Experience\MO2\Tools\SSEedit)

Right click/ compatability/ Run as administrator

### Within the game

#### ❗ Some of the Creation Club content 'might' be Borked. I am actively working to repair anything Creation Club that is included in this list. ❗

When destroying tables some lanterns, glazed candles, and horn candles will not drop to the ground. Conversely Some candles might drop to the ground as they now have physics because of the Destructable Syrim mod.

If interupting an ilde animation with another animation it might stick the animation stopping you from doing anything else. click on an activatable item with animation or eat/drink to repair (basically play another animation).

If holding block and doing a bash you might get stuck in the block stance. Press M2 (block key) or M3 (mouse wheel click) again to come out. 

Also if stuck in block you will not be able to attack or cast spells. Press M3 to resume normal play.

#### Note: This can be avoided completely by holding M2 UNTIL the bash animation of hitting M1 is allowed to complete OR by only using M3 to block.

Sometimes when jumping you might get stuck in the jump animation. Jump again to fix

Sometimes the Bow rapid combo attack won't work correctly. Switch weapons then switch back to fix

You will need to use the X (swan dive) or C (Shorter Dive) keys before jumping to trigger a short or long dive animation for Leaps of faith.

Dying during Scripted battle scenes within the Midwood Isle may stick the player in bleed out because of Shadow of Skyrim. If this happens return to previous save and replay.

Scripted Dialog during The Wrath of Nature may not provide the correct dialog options if you have the Bathing Beauties Luxury Suite MCM option to 'Talk about outfit' turned on.

The Fix is to disable this option in BBLS MCM until the Wrath of Nature scripted dialogs and quest is complete.

Transformations from Wrath of Nature mod will crash the game in first person view. Please only transform in 3rd person.

### ❗ DO NOT put iron arrows into a container or drop them out of your inventory❗ This might crash the game. Vanilla bug without any known workaround. Put them in a corpse or sell them instead.

### ❗Remember to remove followers from Follower Framework after dismissing from active service.❗Failure to do so may cause the game to crash on carriage or fast travel.

***

 ## Recommended Difficulty Levels:

***

Level 0-9 Apprentice

Level 10-15 Adept

Level 16-20 Expert

Level 21-30 Master

Level 31 and up Legendry (if you have the stones for it)

The game also has survival built in using Sunhelm but can toggle this on or off along with Cold survival in the MCM.

Some quality of life / fun mods are also included.

Paraglider, magical jumping, bow rapid combo v3, mist flight, and others you can have fun discovering and exploring.

There are added worldspaces to explore as well.

Wyrmstooth and Beyond Reach will start at a certain level but some you will just find in your exploring like Chanterelle, The Shire, Moonpath to Elswyer, Darkend, Skyrim Sewers, Olenvald, and Skyrim Underground.

***

## Removing the Mod List 

***

#### Simply delete the folder, and you have uninstalled it.

## Final Words Before I Let You Go:

***

I designed this mod list to be tougher than anything vanilla with FAR more creatures that are tougher than stock ones.
There is also an alternate death system based on Shadow of Mordor style game play that will make the one that kills you a 'Nemesis' and they may take some of your stuff as well.
I have also included a mod called Unlimited Rings and Amulets to offset the difficulty.
If you open the files for RLE (rogue like encounters) in MO2 left pane (explore) there are esps in there that can be added or removed from the list that can increase spawns or reduce them.
CC Survival mode will conflict with SunHelm survivial. I recommend using ONLY Sunhelm as it covers cold, eat, drink, and sleep needs.

Basically the tools are there to make it as hard or easy as you want. 
Now go forth brave adventurer, and get lost admiring the parallax mud puddles, and ice cube glaciers......But Beware as the world is full of dangers and rewards.
Have fun :)
Nico
