## Overview:

***

This is the mod list I personally play. I would describe it as a power fantasy list with 
emphasis on visuals, combat, new creatures, new places, and fast paced game play.
I could write a book on this, and still have more to say so I will just put it to you like this.
I am very OCD, and want the best of everything in my Skyrim. 
This mod list is the result of playing and modding this game since the day of it's release
So if you're looking for a visually stunning Skyrim experience that will push the graphical 
limits of what Skyrim can be I invite you to take a trip through
The Nico Experience 

***

## Requirements and Information

***

### Disclaimer

**The Nico Experience** only supports **English Steam** versions of Skyrim Anniversary Edition. **GOG and other Languages are not supported**. The specific version used is 1.5.97 with the creation club content from 1.6.1170.

:warning: :exclamation: **THE NICO EXPERIENCE REQUIRES THE FULL PAID UPDATE TO SKYRIM ANNIVERSARY EDITION. IT IS NOT/WILL NOT BE MADE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NON PAID UPDATE OR OLDER VERSIONS** :exclamation: :warning:

Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK**. Your windows version **must be 21H2 or newer** to run both Wabbajack and **The Nico Experience**.

Running the list from Hard Disk Drives or external drives is **STRONGLY ADVISED AGAINST**. A lot of content is swapped at game run time and, as a result, fast storage and RAM are needed.

***

## Recommended System Specifications

***

**The Nico Experience** requires a mid to high-tier modern system to run to its fullest potential. The recommended specs given below are based on utilizing the ENB in the list, and running the included VRAMr at Performance settings. For community shaders, you can subtract a little bit from them. Users have reported being able to run on hardware slightly lower than this, however your mileage may vary.

| Component    | Recommended for 1080p | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| CPU | 10th Generation i5 or better/equivalent
| Ram | 16GB DDR4 Ram  + 40GB Pagefile 
| Storage | SATA SSD or higher
| GPU | RTX 3060 or better/equivalent (12 GB VRAM)

| Component    | Recommended for 1440p | 
|:--------------:|:-------------:|
| CPU | 12th Generation i7 or better/equivalent
| Ram | 32GB DDR4 Ram  + 40GB Pagefile 
| Storage | M.2 SSD
| GPU | RTX 4070ti Super or better/equivalent (16GB + VRAM)

Space required: ~153GB Archives  ~292GB install Size  40GB Page file ~485GB Total so recommend 500GB of space allocated for this list.

See how to setup a page file here: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows-10,36929.html

:warning: **NOTE**: AMD RX 580 and older cards are **not supported**. :warning:

***

## Installation

***

Installing **The Nico Experience** is relatively easy and, if you have Nexus Premium, will be a simple waiting game. If you are updating the modlist, you can safely skip to the [updating section](README.md#updating).

***

  ## Pre-installation

  Prior to installing **The Nico Experience**, please complete the following steps.


1. Install [Visual C++ x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) & [.Net Runtime v5 desktop x64](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0/runtime).
2. Change Skyrim so it does not [automatically update](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71AB-698D-57EB-178C#disable).
3. Fully uninstall Skyrim by deleting the folder and the Skyrim Special edition folder inside \Documents\My Games\.
4. Fully disable OneDrive and any other programs which hook into user file areas.
5. Reinstall Skyrim into a location that is not Program files. Somewhere like `C:\Games` is a good location. If you only have one drive, look into LostDragonist's [SteamLibrary tool](https://github.com/LostDragonist/steam-library-setup-tool/wiki/Usage-Guide).
6. Start the game once and let it do the graphics check. Do not worry about the settings as it will be replaced during installation.
7. Launch the game to the main menu and allow it to download the paid addon files. **DO NOT VERIFY YOUR GAME FILES**
8. Remove/Disable any 3rd party antivirus such as MalwareBytes or Webroot. These **will** mess with the installation and, in the case of the latter, causes more problems than it solves.
9. **Install the Skyrim Special Edition: Creation Kit on Steam and run it at least once.** [Link to Creation Kit on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946180/Skyrim_Special_Edition_Creation_Kit/)

***

  ## Wabbajack Installation

Once you have completed pre-installation, download the [Latest version of Wabbajack](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases) and place it in a folder such as `C:\Games\Wabbajack`. Do not place it in program files, on your desktop or in your downloads folder. I recommend placing it on an SSD as it will work quicker on there.

:warning: **NOTE**: **The Nico Experience** will **always** require the latest version of Wabbajack **UNLESS IT IS SPECIFICALLY STATED HERE**. :warning:

***

  ## Downloading and Installing The Nico Experience

Downloading and installing **The Nico Experience** can take a while depending on your internet connection and computer. To install, complete the following steps.

1. Open Wabbajack and click on browse modlists. At the top in the GAmes Window choose Skyrim Special Edition. Check mark next to Show Unofficial Lists.
2. Press the download button on The Nico Expereince, and wait for it to download.
3. Set the installation folder to be somewhere like C:\The Nico Expereince. **Do not install it to your desktop or downloads folder.**
4. The download location does not need to be on a SSD but it makes installing a bit faster.
5. Press the play button to begin.
6. Go and pet your nearest fluffy animal whilst Wabbajack does its thing. Alternatively read through this readme again.
7. If the installation is successful, jump for joy and move onto [post installation](#post-installation). If the installation is unsuccessful, follow what is below.

***

## Problems with installation

***

It is possible that you may encounter an error with Wabbajack when installing. Some common issues are listed below.

- Could not download x:
	- Big files or files hosted on metered connections like google drive can fail to download due to connection issues. You can either run Wabbajack again or download the file manually. If you decide to manually download it, make sure to place it in the same place as the other downloads.
 
### Potentially Problematic Files

- [[Dint999] BDOR Hairs SSE 0.17](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1tpY3bDs-LR6rptf8oPUfraKs1CkxJJB3&export=download)
- [[Dint999] HairPack02 SSE 1.11 (base)](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1Ts0sQz3hDxhCeS_LUnXJQFuws_qbw9YQ&export=download)
- [[dint999] BDOr Winter Mountain Guardian Spirit v1.1](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1siyc644OSI0Lz8PlM9lo3Gxf_VxQLlN5&export=download)
  
    - **Make sure you have downloaded all the Paid AE update content!**
  
	- Make sure you have the Creation Kit installed. Go back to [Pre-Installation](README.md#pre-installation) and read it properly this time.

- Wabbajack could not find my game folder:

	- Either buy the game or go back to the [Pre-Installation](README.md#pre-installation) step.

- Antivirus reports a virus:
	- You did not follow the steps in [Pre-Installation](README.md#pre-installation). Go back and follow it.
	- If you have followed it then you can fix this by [adding an exclusion for Mod Organizer in Windows Defender](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/exclude-a-folder-from-windows-security-scan). 

***

## Post Installation

***

❗  **IMPORTANT STEP DO NOT SKIP** ❗

## Run VRAMr on performance setting

### You can find VRAMr at the far right of the top of MO2 where all the executables are.

#### This will take about an hour to run but important to reduce VRAM Usage and avoid system stutter while playing. Recommend Performance setting for everyone.

- [Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se6oAvmtaBE&t=1s)

Once complete drag and drop the folder it creates (that is clearly marked "DragNDropThisFolderIntoModManager") between Texgen_Output and Dyndolod_Output in MO2 '94. LOD Generation Output'

Allow it time to install then activate the plug in by clicking on the box to checkmark it.

❗ **IMPORTANT NOTE** ❗

In the right pane of MO2 click on 'Data' at the top.
Navigate to Textures/interface/intfullnebulapanarama02.dds
Right click / Hide 

This is because VRAMr **WILL** downsize the image of the girls in the perk interface and we are hiding the one from VRAMr so that it uses the higher resolution original one.

### Stock Game

The Nico Experience utilizes a Wabbajack technology called Stock Game. What this essentially does is create a copy of your Skyrim installation within the installation location of the list. This enables greater compatibility with other mod-lists.


### Change this line

#### In MO2 find 'Tools' in the top left and click on it. Navigate to ini editor/ SkyrimPrefs.ini/[Launcher] sD3DDevice="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090

Change this line to reflect the graphics card you are using:

This could also be done by running BethINI IIRC but good to check afterward to make sure it's referencing the correct card being used.

### Set your affinity

In MO2 top left find the tools tab again, and click on it.

Find: 
### *Set CPU Affinity* 

Click it and allow it to set the affinty for your processor.

***

## Widescreen Support

***

### Optional Setting the HUD for widescreen resolution.

Search in MO2 Left pane for 'Widescreen' and again for 'Ultrawide'.

#### *Enable all of them (There should be 4 files found).*

### **Don't forget to run Bethini and change your resolution**

### You will also need to change a line in display tweaks to match your resolution

    In the left pane of MO2 type 'Display Teaks' in the search bar
    Open to: SKSE\Plugins\SSEDisplayTweaks.ini
    Find the lines:
    Resolution = 1920x1080
    ResolutionScale = .80
    Change the resolution to match your chosen resolution then save


## Congratulations you are now installed and ready for first start up.

***

## First Start up

***

Open the installation folder and double-click on the program called `ModOrganizer.exe`. 

Make sure the dropdown box on the right is set to `The Nico Experience` and press the `Run` button. 

Alternate method is clicking on the .exe link at the top labeled `The Nico Experience (version number)`

This will start the game and bring you to the character creation menu.

After your character is created and you name them >>>

 ### The MCM Menu:

As of Version 1_3_2 the MCM Recorder should Auto Run on new game start with recommended settings.

### ❗ IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALLOW THE MCM RECORDER FULLY COMPLETE BEFORE CONTINUING (61/61 steps) ❗

#### *If this fails for any reason or gets stuck you can edit the .ini for MCM Recorder in MO2 and disable the auto run feature* 

You can still go through the menu and change things to suit your preference afterward but this will give you a solid base to start from.

#### Some important things to leave disabled for stability reasons

Leave Minatours and Spiders Off in OBIS

Leave Extra spawns Ore Guardians Off in Immersive Creatures

Leave shadows OFF in Strange Runes

#### By default The voice for PC head tracking and Dragonborn voice over is set for Ciri. This can be changed in the MCM.

### ❗ IT IS RECOMMENDED AT THIS TIME TO OPEN THE IN GAME MENU TO 'CONTROLS' AND CHANGE ANY KEY BINDINGS TO SUIT YOUR PERSONAL PREFERENCES ❗

#### *NOTE: All these can be changed to suit your preference either in settings/controls menu in game, the MCM menu or through the ini files for the specific mod found in MO2 left pane.*

 ## About Adding More Tools:

***

All the tools you choose to install in addition to these need to link in the top right executable bar in MO2 so these programs can start from within the virtual file structure of MO2.
This Wabbajack uses a file structure that contains a folder called 'Stock Folder' in the MO2 directory.
This is where the game will run from. It will NOT run from Skyrim Special Editions Folder so ALL links to executables NEED to point to the Stock Folder in Arguements to work correctly.
 

Find this in MO2 executable bar under <EDIT....> then on the binary click the 3 dots and navigate to your file path for that exe to change this file paths to lead to your specific file install paths OR IT WILL NOT WORK. They are currently set for my file paths. Use those as a reference on how to set them up.
Good tutorial on how to set these up is here >>>>
[Tutorial on setting up executables in stock folder](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Setting%20up%20Stock%20Game%20for%20Skyrim%20SE.md#tool-setup)

***

  ## Some Notes On Basic System Set Up:

***
	
This mod list IS graphically taxing on the hardware but systems can run it if they have the room to breathe.
I'm not going to hold your hand on this, and assume you know Google-fu for anything you don't understand here.

1. Turn off any start up programs or background programs that do not need to be on while running the game.   
There are guides on the web on how to go through Services.msc to trim the fat out of the Windows System Services.

2. strip that graphics driver down of any AA, AO, AF settings (Turn off) as those effects will be handled by the game engine or the ENB. 
DO NOT DOUBLE UP ON EFFECTS!  It will kill your framerate and will not look any better than only one doing that specific effect.
Run Gsync if avialable and for Heavens sake DO NOT use the in game vsync. Use driver vsync instead.
Run latency at ultra and any settings you can at high performance in the driver.

3. Run resizable bar if your hardware is capable of it. It widens the bandwidth for better file transfer speeds (i.e. smoother gameplay)
Panjano has a good video on how to set this up
 [>>>Here<<<](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DqcgHtkm9I)


4. Go to system settings and set virtual memory on the drive the mod organizer is on at 40GB min and 40GB Max. Save and restart.
This will be your swap file and supplement the VRAM if needed.

5. Make sure your power plan is set for High performance and **NOT** balanced or power saver

***

## Performance Tweaks

***

   Here are some things I recommend if your framerate is still suffering after applying the Performance VRAMr and following the notes on 'Basic system set up' above.

  1. Run BethINI (included tool) and choose a lower preset setting like Medium. The default is High. Be sure to NOT use Ambient Occusion, Screen Space Reflections, and turn Tree LOD Distance to '0'. These effects are being handled by Reshade, ENB, and DynDOLOD. Remember DO NOT DOUBLE UP ON EFFECTS! It will cost twice the frame cost with no change in visuals!
   
  2. Turn the settings on the effects in ENB to low or medium (default is high/Very high). These are in the left pane when you open ENB and can be seen when expanding each effect individually.
   
  3. Run at a lower resolution. 
   
  4. Lower the grass density in 'Explore Virtual Folder/Net Script Framework/Plugins/GrassControlConfig.txt/OverwriteMinGrassSize = 65' by INCREASING this number to something like 75-80.
  
  5. Go into Display Tweaks in the left pane of MO2 (search it then explore to SSEDisplayTweaks.ini) and lower this line number value:
         ResolutionScale = 0.85
  To something like .75

### ❗  Lowering this value too much WILL make the Wheeler menu partially off screen so test any changes  ❗

  This will reduce the resolution but also decrease the amount of pixels the game needs to render helping frame rate.    
   Try to find a happy medium between graphical fidelity and FPS.


   ## *Some Users have reported being able to run this list on hardware BELOW the minimum I feel it needs*

   In addition to the tweaks recommended above people have removed the ENB and reshade from the list to trade graphical fidelity for frame rate.

   I have seen this list play on a 1080ti trading ENB and reshade for Community Shaders.

   We do have a topic in the Discord for people to discuss what they have done to get it to run on hardware below the recommended minimum.

***

  ## Known Issues:

***

## With MO2 Executables not working as intended

Find the tools folder within your MO2 installation folder, and the .exe of the application inside it's respective folder (Example: D:\The Nico Experience\MO2\Tools\SSEedit)

Right click/ compatability/ Run as administrator

## Within the game

When destroying tables some lanterns, glazed candles, and horn candles will not drop to the ground. Conversely Some candles might drop to the ground as they now have physics because of the Destructable Syrim mod.

If interupting an ilde animation with another animation it might stick the animation stopping you from doing anything else. click on an activatable item with animation or eat/drink to repair (basically play another animation).

If holding block and doing a bash you might get stuck in the block stance. Press M2 (block key) again to come out.

Sometimes when jumping you might get stuck in the jump animation. Jump again to fix

Sometimes the Bow rapid combo attack won't work correctly. Switch weapons then switch back to fix

Sometimes the game gets confused if you're in first person or third (i.e. MCO step forward animations will not step forward) Quicksave/quickload to repair or change from 3rd person to 1st person and draw or sheath a weapon then switch back to 3rd person.

You will need to use the X (swan dive) or C (Shorter Dive) keys before jumping to trigger a short or long dive animation for Leaps of faith.

***

 ## Recommended Difficulty Levels (if running solo):

***

Level 0-9 Apprentice

Level 10-15 Adept

Level 16-20 Expert

Level 21-30 Master

Level 31 and up Legendry (if you have the stones for it)

The game also has survival built in using Sunhelm but can toggle this on or off along with Cold survival in the MCM.

Some quality of life / fun mods are also included.

Paraglider, magical jumping, bow rapid combo v3, mist flight, and others you can have fun discovering and exploring.

There are added worldspaces to explore as well.

Wyrmstooth and Beyond Reach will start at a certain level but some you will just find in your exploring like Chanterelle, The Shire, Moonpath to Elswyer, Darkend, Skyrim Sewers, and Skyrim Underground.

# Final Words Before I Let You Go:

***

I designed this mod list to be tougher than anything vanilla with FAR more creatures that are tougher than stock ones.
There is also an alternate death system based on Shadow of Mordor style game play that will make the one that kills you a 'Nemesis' and they may take some of your stuff as well.
I have also included a mod called Unlimited Rings and Amulets to offset the difficulty.
If you open the files for RLE (rogue like encounters) in MO2 left pane (explore) there are esps in there that can be added or removed from the list that can increase spawns or reduce them.
CC Survival mode will conflict with SunHelm survivial. I recommend using ONLY Sunhelm as it covers cold, eat, drink, and sleep needs.

Basically the tools are there to make it as hard or easy as you want. 
Now go forth brave adventurer, and get lost admiring the parallax mud puddles, and ice cube glaciers......But Beware as the world is full of dangers and rewards.
Have fun :)
Nico
