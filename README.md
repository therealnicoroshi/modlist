# Overview:
 

This is the mod list I personally play. I would describe it as a power fantasy list with 
emphasis on visuals, combat, new creatures, new places, and fast paced game play.
I could write a book on this, and still have more to say so I will just put it to you like this.
I am very OCD, and want the best of everything in my Skyrim. 
This mod list is the result of playing and modding this game since the day of it's release
So if you're looking for a visually stunning Skyrim experience that will push the graphical 
limits of what Skyrim can be I invite you to take a trip through
The Nico Experience 


 # Requirements and Information:

 
This modlist requires the Steam version of Skyrim AE v. 1.6.1170 with paid CC content.

It will auto Downgrade and run Skyrim SE 1.5.97 with CC content.

It is released with Open Permissions per the Wabbajack License Agreement 

[Wabbajack License](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)

Support will be provided for non-modified installations of the mod list via the Discord server

[Discord Invite Link](https://discord.gg/kHehbzuFZ4)

### *We will only support legally purchased copies of the game*



 # Recommended Minimum Hardware:
  
Absolute minimum if using every provided option for optimization is:

Video card with 12GB of VRAM

Processor of 3Gz or better and minumum 4 cores

16GB system ram

Sata SSD with minimum 500 GB of free space and 40GB virtual memory 

   NOTE: The minimum specs will certainly struggle to maintain 30-50fps

 
  # Ideal Specs:

Video Card with 24GB of VRAM

Processor of 4.5GHz or better and 16+ cores

32 GB of system Ram

M.2 nVMe drive with minimum 500 GB of free space and 40GB virtual memory

If you fall somewhere between these two you can play it. Optimization is KEY for any specs so read this to the end for recommended configuration.


# Installation:
  ## Pre-install:
1. Install a fresh copy of Skyrim AE from Steam version 1.6.1170
2. Install the Creation Kit from Steam
3. Launch the game once from Steam and at the prompt download all CC Content from the full version of AE.
4. Start new game and after hearing  "So you're finally awake" open console (~) and type QQQ then press enter to quit out.

  ## >Important Note<:
**You will need a Vector Plexis account for High Poly Head download in the Wabbajack**


  ## Main Install:

Make sure you are on the latest version of Wabbajack. As of this readme writing it's 3.5.0.1

[Wabbajack Version 3.5.0.1](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/releases/tag/3.5.0.1)


1. Browse to The Nico Experience wabbajack, and click the Download arrow in the bottom right corner.
2. When download is complete click the play arrow in the same location.
3. Choose your install location, and Download location in the Wabbajack window.
  ### **Make sure the install location is minimum 500GB and OUTSIDE of any program or system files**

  ### NOTE: **There will be one file that requires you choose and click the download on Vector Plexus window. The file you want is High Poly Head v1.4 SE**

After that file is downloaded the rest of the install should be automated.


 # Post Installation:

   ### MO2 and System Settings
   
   ## 1. Run mod organizer as admin.
   
   Right click the Mod Organiazer 2.exe located in the MO2 folder and click on Properties.
   
   In the Compatability Tab check mark 'Run this Program as Administrator'
   
   ## 2. Exclude MO2 from your Anti-Virus
   
   For Windows Defender click Windows tab in bottom left
   
   Type 'Virus' and select 'virus and threat protection'/ 'Manage settings'/ 'Exclusions'/ 'Add or remove exclusions'
   
   Add an Exclusion and navigate to your Mod Organizer 2. exe

   ## 3. Disable Steam Overlay
   
   Find the game in your Steam Library then go to Properties
   
   Under the General tab, you'll find a checkbox for Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game.
   
   Make sure it's unchecked.
   
   ## 4. Check the Stock Game folder location

   Navigate to (Drive letter):\Where\you\installed\the Wabbajack\ModOrganizer.ini
   
   This example is where I installed it
   
   gamePath=@ByteArray(C:\\Wabbajack<\\The Nico Experience\\Mod Organizer 2\\Stock Game

Yours might look different but the idea is to point it to where your Stock Game folder is located in the new install

It may already be pointed in the correct location but good to check.

   ## 5. Choose your LOD

In MO2 left pane go to #93 LOD Generation_Output Tab

  ### Choose either (based on the VRAM of your video card):

VRAMr_Output for 16GB cards (On by default)
or 
VRAMr_Output for 12GB cards

Depending on your graphics card VRAM amount.

  ## *CHOOSE ONLY ONE TO ACTIVATE*

  ## 6. Choose your profile

### There are 2 included profiles to choose from based on screen resolution

Default game profile resolution is 1920x1080. 

21:9 profile is set for 3440x1440 but can be used for widescreen 1080p as well.

Choose and select the one that fits your screen resolution.

  ### *Don't forget to change your resolution in Bethini to match your screen resolution.*

  ## 7. Set your affinity

In MO2 top left find the tools tab, and click on it.

Find: 
### *Set CPU Affinity* 

Click it and allow it to set the affinty for your processor.

## 8. Optional files I will offer support for if added to the list

There are BDOR armor mods that were included in v.1.2.3 that were problematic for installation through Wabbajack so were removed in v.1.2.4

### *These files are completely optional, and not required for the list to run.*

They can be added manually through MO2 if you choose to do so and can be found on the Discord in:

'Suggested Additions You Might Like for the Mod List'

*I will still offer support for the mod list if you decide to add these specific files.*



## Congratulations you are now installed and set up.


 # Included Tools:

Bethini Pie

SSEedit and QuickAutoClean

LOOT

Cathedral Assets Optimizer

Nemesis

Bodyslide and Outfit Studio

NifSkope


 # About Adding More Tools:


All the tools you choose to install in addition to these need to link in the top right executable bar in MO2 so these programs can start from within the virtual file structure of MO2.
This Wabbajack uses a file structure that contains a folder called 'Stock Folder' in the MO2 directory.
This is where the game will run from. It will NOT run from Skyrim Special Editions Folder so ALL links to executables NEED to point to the Stock Folder in Arguements to work correctly.
 

Find this in MO2 executable bar under <EDIT....> then on the binary click the 3 dots and navigate to your file path for that exe to change this file paths to lead to your specific file install paths OR IT WILL NOT WORK. They are currently set for my file paths. Use those as a reference on how to set them up.
Good tutorial on how to set these up is here >>>>
[Tutorial on setting up executables in stock folder](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Setting%20up%20Stock%20Game%20for%20Skyrim%20SE.md#tool-setup)



  # Some Notes On Basic System Set Up:
	
This mod list IS graphically taxing on the hardware but systems can run it if they have the room to breathe.
I'm not going to hold your hand on this, and assume you know Google-fu for anything you don't understand here.

1. Turn off any start up programs or background programs that do not need to be on while running the game.   
[Blackviper.com](https://www.blackviper.com/) is a wonderful resource on trimming the fat out of the Windows System Services.

2. strip that graphics driver down of any AA, AO, AF settings (Turn off) as those effects will be handled by the game engine or the ENB. 
DO NOT DOUBLE UP ON EFFECTS!  It will kill your framerate and will not look any better than only one doing that specific effect.
Run Gsync if avialable and for Heavens sake DO NOT use the in game vsync. Use driver vsync instead.
Run latency at ultra and any settings you can at high performance in the driver.

3. Run resizable bar if your hardware is capable of it. It widens the bandwidth for better file transfer speeds (i.e. smoother gameplay)
Panjano has a good video on how to set this up
 [>>>Here<<<](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DqcgHtkm9I)


4. Go to system settings and set virtual memory on the drive the mod organizer is on at 40GB min and 40GB Max. Save and restart.
This will be your swap file and supplement the VRAM if needed.

5. Some completely optional things I personally use that dramatically help the frame rate (but are paid mods so decide for yourself if they are right for you)

 # The MCM Menu:

Alright.....There is a LOT here.

There are many character presets included for most races and genders. Be sure to check which race the preset is for before applying it as it might look strange on a different race.

I recommend simply going through the MCM menu one at a time, and set how you like it.

It is IMPORTANT to leave Minatours and Spiders turned OFF for OBIS, ore guardians OFF in Immersive creatures, and shadows OFF for Strange Runes as they are KNOWN to crash the game. 

Magical jumping should be lore friendly in the MCM. Change it to NON-Lore friendly in the MCM to get magical jumping by default.

Magical Jumping: this can be kind of glitchy with other mods in the list.

What I did:

Set lore friendly mode to 'OFF'. In the SKSE folder DTry Ultilities find magical jumping and comment OUT using ; everything that is not already commented out.

This disables the dash, and bash parts but keeps NO fall damage on and allows for triple jumping magical jumps by default


# *Some Important Default Keys To Know*:

Caps Lock + Enter = ENB Menu

Caps Lock + F12 = Toggle ENB Effect

Backspace = Immersive Equipment Displays

Shift + O = Open Animation Replacer

Ins = Blink Spell Hotkey (Can be modified in it's ini file)

X = Toggle HUD and swan dive jump

C = Short Dive jump and quicklight

Scroll wheel = walk\run speed adjustment on the fly

K (Hold) + Scroll Wheel = Zoom

Dodges= Direction + Left Shift (can be changed in ini file for TK Dodge RE)

G = walk/Run Toggle

Left Control = Wheeler menu

Shift = sprint

Del = dMenu

Home = Reshade menu


While falling

Paraglider pull or put away = activate key


How I set some Keys in the MCM Recorder

Page Down = Proteus Wheel

Page Up = SMP reset

; : = quicksave (but set to make these regular saves in Engine fixes)

' " = quickload

9 ( = toggle EVG traversal markers on/off

= + = PC head tracking Hello

- _ = PC head Tracking Goodbye
- 
0 ) = PC head Tracking Random Saying
  
C = Quicklight toggle


# Setting the HUD for 21x9 resolution.

In the MCM Menu:

SkyUI:

Set 3D Item to H= 24, and Scale to 1.2. 

Set Item Card to H= - 225.

Show Player in Menus:

X Offset = 50

TrueHUD:

Set X to - 0.125 for Player Widget.


# *Word Of Warning*:

Some creatures will be deleveled so you might come across a level 30 ogre at level 1 and have to run to survive. Ye have been warned!
You will learn....stick and move, stick and dodge, run and heal or just plain run away to survive at lower levels.

 # Recommended Difficulty Levels:

Level 0-9 Apprentice

Level 10-15 Adept

Level 16-20 Expert

Level 21-30 Master

Level 31 and up Legendry (if you have the stones for it)

The game also has survival built in using Sunhelm but can toggle this on or off along with Cold survival in the MCM.

Some quality of life / fun mods are also included.

Paraglider, magical jumping, bow rapid combo v3, mist flight, and others you can have fun discovering and exploring.

There are added worldspaces to explore as well.

Wyrmstooth and Beyond Reach will start at a certain level but some you will just find in your exploring like Chanterelle, The Shire, Moonpath to Elswyer, Darkend, Skyrim Sewers, and Skyrim Underground.

# Final Words Before I Let You Go:

I designed this mod list to be tougher than anything vanilla with FAR more creatures that are tougher than stock ones.
As such I have included a mod called skyrim skill uncapper. It has an ini file you can tweak to your liking increasing (or decreasing) the amount of perk points per level as well as amount things like health, magica, and stamina go up per level. Default it is set up with an ini designed for use with Ordinator which is the main perk mod in this list.
I have also included a mod called Unlimited Rings and Amulets to offset the difficulty.
If you open the files for RLE (rogue like encounters) in MO2 left pane (explore) there are esps in there that can be added or removed from the list that can increase spawns or reduce them.
CC Survival mode will conflict with SunHelm survivial. I recommend using ONLY Sunhelm as it covers cold, eat, drink, and sleep needs.

Basically the tools are there to make it as hard or easy as you want. 
Now go forth brave adventurer, and get lost admiring the parallax mud puddles, and ice cube glaciers......But Beware as the world is full of dangers and rewards.
Have fun :)
Nico
