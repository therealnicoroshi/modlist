# Overview:
 

This is the mod list I personally play. I would describe it as a power fantasy list with 
emphasis on visuals, combat, new creatures, new places, and fast paced game play.
I could write a book on this, and still have more to say so I will just put it to you like this.
I am very OCD, and want the best of everything in my Skyrim. 
This mod list is the result of playing and modding this game since the day of it's release
So if you're looking for a visually stunning Skyrim experience that will push the graphical 
limits of what Skyrim can be I invite you to take a trip through
The Nico Experience 


 # Requirements and Information:

##    The number one requirement is that you read and follow the instructions written here. Please don't skip ANY steps because you think you already have it or don't need it. About 95% of EVERY issue people had on the discord is due to NOT following this simple requirement.

### This modlist requires the Steam version of Skyrim AE v. 1.6.1170

### All Anniversary Edition Creation Club Content

### The Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit

  ## >Important Note<:
  
### **You will need a Vector Plexis and LoversLab account in addition to a Nexus premium account**

It is released with Open Permissions per the Wabbajack License Agreement 

[Wabbajack License](https://github.com/wabbajack-tools/wabbajack/blob/main/LICENSE.txt)

Support will be provided for non-modified installations of the mod list via the Discord server

[Discord Invite Link](https://discord.gg/kHehbzuFZ4)

## *We will only offer support for legally purchased copies of the game from Steam installed following this installation guide on hardware that meets or exceeds the minimum requirements With UNMODIFIED versions of this list*



 # Recommended Minimum Hardware:
  
Absolute minimum if using every provided option for optimization, and run VRAMr at 'performance' settings is:

Video card with 12GB of VRAM

Processor of 3Gz or better and minumum 4 cores

16GB system ram

Sata SSD with minimum 500 GB of free space and 40GB virtual memory 

   NOTES: The minimum specs will certainly struggle to maintain 30-50fps with ENB and Reshade enabled.

## It has been reported that this list CAN play on a 1080ti and on a 2060 with ENB and reshade removed and settings tweaked

 
  # Ideal Specs:

Video Card with 24GB of VRAM

Processor of 4.5GHz or better and 16+ cores

32 GB of system Ram

M.2 nVMe drive with minimum 500 GB of free space and 40GB virtual memory

If you fall somewhere between these two you can play it. Optimization is KEY for any specs so read this to the end for recommended configuration.


# Installation:

 # Post Installation:

   ### MO2 and System Settings
   
   ## 1. Exclude MO2 from your Anti-Virus
   
   For Windows Defender click Windows tab in bottom left
   
   Type 'Virus' and select 'virus and threat protection'/ 'Manage settings'/ 'Exclusions'/ 'Add or remove exclusions'
   
   Add an Exclusion and navigate to your Mod Organizer 2. exe

   ## 2. Disable Steam Overlay
   
   Find the game in your Steam Library then go to Properties
   
   Under the General tab, you'll find a checkbox for Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game.
   
   Make sure it's unchecked. 
   
   While you're there change the hotkey to something you would NEVER hit by accident as a precaution.

   ## 3. Choose your LOD

By default this list will require up to 20GB of Vram to run smoothly.

## If you want to run this list with a card that has less Vram than that you will need to run the included VRAMr program (in Executables at top right in MO2) for either performance (12GB) or Quality (16GB) as I cannot include these files for you.

## This will take about an hour to run but important to reduce VRAM Usage and avoid system stutter while playing.

- [Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se6oAvmtaBE&t=1s)

Once complete drag and drop the folder it creates (that is clearly marked "DragNDropThisFolderIntoModManager") between Texgen_Output and Dyndolod_Output in MO2 '93. LOD Generation Output'

  ## 4. Change this line

### In the MO2 folder find the folder 'profiles'. Within that find SkyrimPrefs.ini

Change this line to reflect the graphics card you are using:

[Launcher]
sD3DDevice="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090"

This could also be done by running BethINI IIRC but good to check afterward to make sure it's referncing the correct card being used.

  ## 5. Set your affinity

In MO2 top left find the tools tab, and click on it.

Find: 
### *Set CPU Affinity* 

Click it and allow it to set the affinty for your processor.

## 6. AMD Specific Requirements 

### *This also Applies to Any non-RTX nVidia Graphics card*

In MO2 left pane find line #4 Optimization, and expand

Uncheck SkyrimUpscaler as it's set up for DLAA which won't work on AMD, and non- RTX cards (will cause crash)

If you uncheck this I recommend using TAA by turning it on in Bethini


## 7. Optional Setting the HUD for widescreen resolution.

Search in MO2 Left pane for 'Widescreen' and again for 'Ultrawide'.

Enable all of them.

### **Don't forget to run Bethini and change your resolution**

### You will also need to change a line in display tweaks to match your resolution

    In the left pane of MO2 type 'Display Teaks' in the search bar
    Open to: SKSE\Plugins\SSEDisplayTweaks.ini
    Find the lines:
    Resolution = 1920x1080
    ResolutionScale = .80
    Change the resolution to match your chosen resolution then save
	  

If running 21:9 3440x1440 change these in the MCM

SkyUI:

Set 3D Item to H= 24, and Scale to 1.2. 

Set Item Card to H= - 225.

Show Player in Menus:

X Offset = 50

TrueHUD:

Set X to - 0.125 for Player Widget.



## Congratulations you are now installed and set up.


 # Included Tools:

Bethini Pie

SSEedit and QuickAutoClean

LOOT

Cathedral Assets Optimizer

Nemesis

Bodyslide and Outfit Studio

NifSkope

ReSaver

VRAMr


 # About Adding More Tools:


All the tools you choose to install in addition to these need to link in the top right executable bar in MO2 so these programs can start from within the virtual file structure of MO2.
This Wabbajack uses a file structure that contains a folder called 'Stock Folder' in the MO2 directory.
This is where the game will run from. It will NOT run from Skyrim Special Editions Folder so ALL links to executables NEED to point to the Stock Folder in Arguements to work correctly.
 

Find this in MO2 executable bar under <EDIT....> then on the binary click the 3 dots and navigate to your file path for that exe to change this file paths to lead to your specific file install paths OR IT WILL NOT WORK. They are currently set for my file paths. Use those as a reference on how to set them up.
Good tutorial on how to set these up is here >>>>
[Tutorial on setting up executables in stock folder](https://github.com/LivelyDismay/Learn-To-Mod/blob/main/lessons/Setting%20up%20Stock%20Game%20for%20Skyrim%20SE.md#tool-setup)



  # Some Notes On Basic System Set Up:
	
This mod list IS graphically taxing on the hardware but systems can run it if they have the room to breathe.
I'm not going to hold your hand on this, and assume you know Google-fu for anything you don't understand here.

1. Turn off any start up programs or background programs that do not need to be on while running the game.   
There are guides on the web on how to go through Services.msc to trim the fat out of the Windows System Services.

2. strip that graphics driver down of any AA, AO, AF settings (Turn off) as those effects will be handled by the game engine or the ENB. 
DO NOT DOUBLE UP ON EFFECTS!  It will kill your framerate and will not look any better than only one doing that specific effect.
Run Gsync if avialable and for Heavens sake DO NOT use the in game vsync. Use driver vsync instead.
Run latency at ultra and any settings you can at high performance in the driver.

3. Run resizable bar if your hardware is capable of it. It widens the bandwidth for better file transfer speeds (i.e. smoother gameplay)
Panjano has a good video on how to set this up
 [>>>Here<<<](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DqcgHtkm9I)


4. Go to system settings and set virtual memory on the drive the mod organizer is on at 40GB min and 40GB Max. Save and restart.
This will be your swap file and supplement the VRAM if needed.


# Performance Tweaks

   Here are some things I recommend if your framerate is still suffering after applying the Performance VRAMr and following the notes on 'Basic system set up' above.

  1. Run BethINI (included tool) and choose a lower preset setting like Medium. The default is High. Be sure to NOT use Ambient Occusion, Screen Space Reflections, and turn Tree LOD Distance to '0'. These effects are being handled by Reshade, ENB, and DynDOLOD. Remember DO NOT DOUBLE UP ON EFFECTS! It will cost twice the frame cost with no change in visuals!
   
  2. Turn the settings on the effects in ENB to low or medium (default is high/Very high). These are in the left pane when you open ENB and can be seen when expanding each effect individually.
   
  3. Run at a lower resolution. 
   
  4. Lower the grass density in 'Explore Virtual Folder/Net Script Framework/Plugins/GrassControlConfig.txt/OverwriteMinGrassSize = 65' by INCREASING this number to something like 75-80.
  
  5. Go into Display Tweaks in the left pane of MO2 (search it then explore to SSEDisplayTweaks.ini) and lower this line number value:
         ResolutionScale = 0.85
  To something like .75   
  This will reduce the resolution but also decrease the amount of pixels the game needs to render helping frame rate.    
   Try to find a happy medium between graphical fidelity and FPS.

  6. Consider frame generation software from Steam.


   ## *Some Users have reported being able to run this list on hardware BELOW the minimum I feel it needs*

   In addition to the tweaks recommended above people have removed the ENB and reshade from the list to trade graphical fidelity for frame rate.

   I have seen this list play on a 1080ti trading ENB and reshade for Community Shaders.

   We do have a topic in the Discord for people to discuss what they have done to get it to run.

   
 # The MCM Menu:

As of Version 1_3_2 the MCM Recorder should Auto Run on new game start with recommended settings.

## *If this fails for any reason or gets stuck you can edit the .ini for MCM Recorder and disable the auto run feature* 

You can still go through the menu and change things to suit your preference afterward but this will give you a solid base to start from.

### Some important things to leave disabled for stability reasons

Leave Minatours and Spiders Off in OBIS

Leave Extra spawns Ore Guardians Off in Immersive Creatures

Leave shadows OFF in Strange Runes

### All Custom Skills can be accessed via a spell that is added to your inventory 

  # Known Issues:

## With MO2 Executables not working as intended

Find the tools folder within your MO2 installation folder, and the .exe of the application inside it's respective folder (Example: D:\The Nico Experience\MO2\Tools\SSEedit)

Right click/ compatability/ Run as administrator

## Within the game

When destroying tables some lanterns, glazed candles, and horn candles will not drop to the ground. Conversely Some candles might drop to the ground as they now have physics because of the Destructable Syrim mod.

If interupting an ilde animation with another animation it might stick the animation stopping you from doing anything else. click on an activatable item with animation or eat/drink to repair (basically play another animation).

If holding block and doing a bash you might get stuck in the block stance. Press M2 (block key) again to come out.

Sometimes when jumping you might get stuck in the jump animation. Jump again to fix

Sometimes the Bow rapid combo attack won't work correctly. Switch weapons then switch back to fix

Sometimes the game gets confused if you're in first person or third (i.e. MCO step forward animations will not step forward) Quicksave/quickload to repair

You will need to use the X (swan dive) or C (Shorter Dive) keys before jumping to trigger a short or long dive animation for Leaps of faith.


# *Some Important Default Keys To Know*:

Caps Lock + Enter = ENB Menu

Caps Lock + F12 = Toggle ENB Effect

Caps Lock + F11 = Toggle Wire Frame

F11 = Toggle A matter of time widget and clock 

Home = Reshade

Backspace = Immersive Equipment Displays

Shift + O = Open Animation Replacer

Shift = Toggle use or take, and talk or pet for cats, dogs, and horses

Ins = Blink Spell Hotkey (Can be modified in it's ini file)

X = Toggle Compass HUD and swan dive jump

C = Short Dive jump and quicklight

Scroll wheel = walk\run speed adjustment on the fly

K (Hold) + Scroll Wheel = Zoom

Dodges= Direction + Left Shift (can be changed in ini file for TK Dodge RE)

G = walk/Run Toggle

Left Control = Wheeler menu

Caps Lock = Sprint

Del = dMenu


While falling

Paraglider pull or put away = activate key


How I set some Keys in the MCM Recorder

Page Down = Proteus Wheel

Page Up = SMP reset

; : = quicksave (but set to make these regular saves in Engine fixes)

' " = quickload

9 ( = toggle EVG traversal markers on/off

= + = PC head tracking Hello

- _ = PC head Tracking Goodbye
- 
0 ) = PC head Tracking Random Saying
  
C = Quicklight toggle


# *Word Of Warning*:

Some creatures will be deleveled so you might come across a level 30 ogre at level 1 and have to run to survive. Ye have been warned!
You will learn....stick and move, stick and dodge, run and heal or just plain run away to survive at lower levels.

 # Recommended Difficulty Levels (if running solo):

Level 0-9 Apprentice

Level 10-15 Adept

Level 16-20 Expert

Level 21-30 Master

Level 31 and up Legendry (if you have the stones for it)

The game also has survival built in using Sunhelm but can toggle this on or off along with Cold survival in the MCM.

Some quality of life / fun mods are also included.

Paraglider, magical jumping, bow rapid combo v3, mist flight, and others you can have fun discovering and exploring.

There are added worldspaces to explore as well.

Wyrmstooth and Beyond Reach will start at a certain level but some you will just find in your exploring like Chanterelle, The Shire, Moonpath to Elswyer, Darkend, Skyrim Sewers, and Skyrim Underground.

# Final Words Before I Let You Go:

I designed this mod list to be tougher than anything vanilla with FAR more creatures that are tougher than stock ones.
As such I have included a mod called skyrim skill uncapper. It has an ini file you can tweak to your liking increasing (or decreasing) the amount of perk points per level as well as amount things like health, magica, and stamina go up per level. Default it is set up with an ini designed for use with Ordinator which is the main perk mod in this list.
I have also included a mod called Unlimited Rings and Amulets to offset the difficulty.
If you open the files for RLE (rogue like encounters) in MO2 left pane (explore) there are esps in there that can be added or removed from the list that can increase spawns or reduce them.
CC Survival mode will conflict with SunHelm survivial. I recommend using ONLY Sunhelm as it covers cold, eat, drink, and sleep needs.

Basically the tools are there to make it as hard or easy as you want. 
Now go forth brave adventurer, and get lost admiring the parallax mud puddles, and ice cube glaciers......But Beware as the world is full of dangers and rewards.
Have fun :)
Nico
